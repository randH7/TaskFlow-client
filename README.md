# TaskFlow
TaskFlow is a dynamic web application designed for efficient task and project management, with a strong emphasis on collaboration and real-time updates. Crafted with a visually appealing and user-friendly UI/UX, leveraging HTML and CSS, and powered by the Angular framework, TaskFlow is the ideal solution for streamlining work processes and managing projects effectively.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.9.

## Design

### Concept:
The TaskFlow logo symbolizes the fluidity and organization of tasks in a collaborative environment. It communicates a sense of synergy and teamwork.

### Logo:
![Logo](Logo.jpg)
I created this logo like flowing, straight lines to represent the smooth flow and organization of tasks. These lines are stylized to look like abstract task cards moving in a sequence.

### Color Palette:
![Color Palette](Colors.jpg)
The color palette includes modern and professional colors, with teal symbolizing trust and reliability.
